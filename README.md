## Course Overview

This course is designed to introduce students to the field of physics-based animation by exposing  them to the underlying mathematical and algorithmic techniques required to understand and develop efficient numerical simulations of physical phenomena such as rigid bodies, deformable bodies and fluids. In Physics-Based Animation we will learn how to develop algorithms that produce visually compelling representations of physical systems.  We will learn the underlying continuous mathematics describing the motion of physical objects, explore how to discretize them and how to solve the resulting discrete equations quickly and robustly. 
  
**Prerequisites:** C/C++ Programming, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Numerical
Methods 

The student is expected to read background material as necessary and should be comfortable with elementary linear algebra, geometry,
and vector calculus. It is also assumed that the student is comfortable
programming in basic C++.

**_(Strongly)_ Recommended preparation:** Multivariable Calculus

[Academic Honesty (required reading)](#academic-honesty)

## Final Project
The final project should involve implementing one  physics-simulation algorithm from a number of choices provided by the professor (**coming soon**). The projects will be taken from popular research papers. While the course will cover all the mathematical an technical concepts required to complete the projects, it will not cover the algorithms in detail. Projects can be done in up to groups of two (2) with no exceptions. 

**Deliverable:** The code for your algorithm (in Python, C++ or MATLAB) along with instructions to compile and run the implementation. A **two (2) page** writeup of the algorithm in the style of a short SIGGRAPH paper. A **5-minute** SIGGRAPH style video showing the results of your method.  

**Due Date:** December 21st at 11:59pm.  

[**Example Report**](https://www.siggraph.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/techbrief-sample.pdf)

[**Example Video**](http://www.nobuyuki-umetani.com/publication/2014_sca_positionbasedelasticrod/2014_sca_PositionBasedElasticRod.html)

**Suggested Structure**

Treat your video like a 5-minute presentation of your work (in lieu of a final presentation). You don't have to show yourself in the video, but a good suggested organization is (1) Introduce the problem (2) Mention the important resources you used (3) Outline the algorithm (4) show some results.

### Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is a very serious matter and can result in very serious
consequences. Note that academic offences may be discovered and handled
retroactively, even after the semester in which the course was taken for credit.
This is a challenging class aimed at teaching you the fundamentals of computer
graphics. You wont learn much if you cheat but you might get a good grade if you
get away with it. If all you want is a good grade take an easier class where you
wont have to cheat!

For purposes of this class, academic dishonesty is defined as:

- Any attempt to pass off work on an assignment that didn't come straight out of your
  own head.
- Any collaboration on written or programming assignments (its ok to share ideas
  on programming assignments but the code MUST be your own) in which the
  collaborating parties don't clearly and prominently explain exactly who did
  what, at turn-in time.
- Any activity that has the effect of significantly impairing the ability of
  another student to learn. Examples here might include destroying the work of
  others, interfering with their access to resources (e.g., digital cameras), or
  deliberately providing them with misleading information.

### Email & Bulletin Board Traffic

- Use GitHub issues for answering questions about class subject matter or about the assignments. The TAs and the instructor will monitor the issues pages. Email sent to the instructor or TAs regarding these matters will be ignored. 
- Remark requests will be handled through MarkUs. 
- Appropriate use of issues page: clarifications on assignment, on lecture
  material, general concerns about the course, or other remarks that are
  appropriate for all students to see/participate in.
- Do NOT broadcast pieces of your code or answers to written assignments to the
   issues page. Specific or general implementation questions whose answer
  would benefit all students in the class are appropriate.
- Questions of the form "I cannot find the problem with my code; here it is, can
  you help me" are unlikely to be replied, so don't count on it.
